# next-blog

## Introduction
This project is a anonymous blog. Users can access it and create its own posts and, optionally, add an author name.
It is connected to an external API, which repository is [this](https://github.com/emiliosanches/next-blog-server).


## Goals
My only goals with this project is to practice and learn about NextJS, which is a technology in which I'm starting my studies.
You can use this however you want. 

If you want to help, please consider cloning the project and helping with the development of new features.

## How to use it
You can clone this project and continue the development by yourself, but you'll need to clone the API project too. 
Otherwise you can use any other API to communicate the next app with and get it working.

Either, you can develop your API using NextJS. See documentation [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

This project doesn't use the Next API Routing for study purposes. I preferred to develop an API using Express to apply some principles and patterns that I recently learned.

If you want to use my API project, you can clone it from its repository [here](https://github.com/emiliosanches/next-blog-server) and follow the steps defined in the README file.
